Analyze Market Share Dynamics in Auto Industry
This project employs a Markov Chain model to analyze market share dynamics in the auto industry, focusing on six major brands—Maruti, Hyundai, Mahindra, Tata, Toyota, and Honda. Through a simulation spanning short-term transitions and long-term steady-state probabilities, the study uncovers insights valuable to stakeholders in the automotive sector. The short-term analysis highlights brand-specific sensitivities to market changes, while the long-term predictions offer a stable equilibrium perspective. Maruti emerges as a consistent market leader, and the findings provide actionable intelligence for investors, policymakers, and industry leaders. Despite model simplifications, the study opens avenues for future research, emphasizing the need for collaboration with industry experts and continuous refinement for enhanced predictive accuracy and real-world applicability. Overall, this project serves as a foundational exploration into market share analysis, paving the way for more nuanced investigations within the dynamic auto industry landscape.This project employs a Markov Chain model to analyze market share dynamics in the auto industry, focusing on six major brands—Maruti, Hyundai, Mahindra, Tata, Toyota, and Honda.
